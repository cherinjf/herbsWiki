HerbsWIKI Cross-platform application (Second year project under Cross-platform application in C++ - Individual) Western medicine known as modern medicine treats the symptoms only but Ayurveda treats the entire body as a one. Modern medicine is a perfect tool for heal people but it often come with side effects. But without knowing herbal plants correctly how we can take benefits from them. Therefor I designed and developed this app as a solution. Knowledge about herbal plants will also help to students and medical researchers for their studies. Tested with windows 10 and Linux Ubuntu
